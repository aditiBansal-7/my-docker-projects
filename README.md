# My-Docker-Projects
This repository serves as a **central hub** for all my **Docker, Kubernetes, and ML projects**. Each project is containerized, well-documented, and includes step-by-step deployment instructions.  

📌 Technologies Used:  

✅ Docker & Docker Compose 🐳 – Containerization and orchestration for efficient deployment.  


✅ MySQL & PostgreSQL Databases 🗄️ – Database setup and integration within Docker containers.  


✅ Streamlit for UI 📊 – Interactive dashboards for ML model deployment and monitoring.  


✅ ML Model Deployment & Monitoring 🤖 – Using Dockerized environments and Evidently AI for model tracking.  


✅ Kubernetes with Minikube & Kubectl ⚙️ – Deploying and managing containerized applications in a local Kubernetes cluster.
